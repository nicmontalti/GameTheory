  abstract     = {The emergence of cooperation in self-centered individuals has been a major puzzle in the study of evolutionary ethics. Reciprocal altruism is one of the explanations put forward and the prisoner’s dilemma has been a paradigm in this context. The emergence of cooperation was demonstrated for the prisoner’s dilemma on a lattice with synchronous update. However, the cooperation disappeared for asynchronous update and the general validity of the conclusions was questioned. Neither synchronous nor asynchronous updates are realistic for natural systems. In this paper, we make a detailed study of a more realistic system of semi-synchronous updates where pN agents are updated at every time instant. We observe a transition from an all-defector state to a mixed state as a function of p. Our studies indicate that despite it being a transition from an absorbing state, it is a first-order transition. Furthermore, we used a damage spreading technique to demonstrate that the transition in this system could be classified as a frozen–chaotic transition.},

  abstract     = {Research has shown that the addition of abstention as an option transforms social dilemmas to rock-paper-scissor type games, where defectors dominate cooperators, cooperators dominate abstainers (loners), and abstainers (loners), in turn, dominate defectors. In this way, abstention can sustain cooperation even under adverse conditions, although defection also persists due to cyclic dominance. However, to abstain or to act as a loner has, to date, always been considered as an independent, third strategy to complement traditional cooperation and defection. Here we consider probabilistic abstention, where each player is assigned a probability to abstain in a particular instance of the game. In the two limiting cases, the studied game reverts to the prisoner’s dilemma game without loners or to the optional prisoner’s dilemma game. For intermediate probabilities, we have a new hybrid game, which turns out to be most favorable for the successful evolution of cooperation. We hope this novel hybrid game provides a more realistic view of the dilemma of optional/voluntary participation.},

  abstract      = {The 2-spin Ising model in statistical mechanics and the 2x2 normal form game in game theory are compared. All configurations allowed by the second are recovered by the first when the only concern is about Nash equilibria. But it holds no longer when Pareto optimum condiderations are introduced like in the prisoner’s dilemma. This gap can nevertheless be filled by adding a new coupling term to the Ising model, even if that term has up to now no physical meaning. An individual complete bilinear objective function is thus found to be sufficient to reproduce all possible configurations of a 2x2 game. Using this one-to-one mapping, new perspectives for future research in both fields can be envisioned.},
